Question 1
Which country has won the most gold medals in summer games?
*This function should return a single string value.*

def answer_one():
    return df['Gold'].idxmax()
df['Gold'].idxmax() 

#'United States'
-----------
Question 2
Which country had the biggest difference between their summer and winter gold medal counts?
This function should return a single string value.

def answer_two():
    return ((df['Gold']-df['Gold.1']).abs()).idxmax()
((df['Gold']-df['Gold.1']).abs()).idxmax()

#'United States'

------------
Question 3
Which country has the biggest difference between their summer gold medal counts and winter gold medal counts relative to their total gold medal count?
Summer Gold−Winter GoldTotal Gold
Summer Gold−Winter GoldTotal Gold
Only include countries that have won at least 1 gold in both summer and winter.
This function should return a single string value.

In[]
def answer_three():
            df_pos = df[(df['Gold']>0) & (df['Gold.1']>0)]
            answer = ((df_pos['Gold']-df_pos['Gold.1'])/(df_pos['Gold.2'])).abs().idxmax()
            return answer      
answer_three()
#'Bulgaria'
-------------
Question 4
Write a function that creates a Series called "Points" which is a weighted value where each gold medal (`Gold.2`) counts for 3 points, silver medals (`Silver.2`) for 2 points, and bronze medals (`Bronze.2`) for 1 point. The function should return only the column (a Series object) which you created, with the country names as indices.
*This function should return a Series named `Points` of length 146*

def answer_four():
         Points = pd.Series(df['Gold.2']*3+df['Silver.2']*2+df['Bronze.2']*1)
         return Points
answer_four()
            
--------------
Question 5
Which state has the most counties in it? (hint: consider the sumlevel key carefully! You'll need this for future questions too...)
This function should return a single string value.

def answer_five():
    sta = census_df[census_df['SUMLEV']==50].groupby('STNAME')['COUNTY'].sum()
    return sta.idxmax()
answer_five()
#'Texas'

#the second solution

def answer_five():
    df = pd.read_csv('census.csv')
    df=df[df['SUMLEV'] == 50]
    sta = df.groupby('STNAME').count()['SUMLEV']#coun() or sum()is ok,if ['SUMLEV'] not there ,it will be two column
    return sta.idxmax()
answer_five()

Question 6
Only looking at the three most populous counties for each state, what are the three most populous states (in order of highest population to lowest population)? Use CENSUS2010POP.
This function should return a list of string values.

def answer_six():
    thr = census_df[census_df['SUMLEV'] == 50].groupby('STNAME')['CENSUS2010POP'].apply(lambda x: x.nlargest(3).sum()).nlargest(3).index.values.tolist()
    return thr
answer_six()

#['California', 'Texas', 'Illinois']


Question 7
Which county has had the largest absolute change in population within the period 2010-2015? (Hint: population values are stored in columns POPESTIMATE2010 through POPESTIMATE2015, you need to consider all six columns.)
e.g. If County Population in the 5 year period is 100, 120, 80, 105, 100, 130, then its largest change in the period would be |130-80| = 50.
This function should return a single string value.
def answer_seven():
          p = census_df[census_df['SUMLEV'] == 50].loc[:,'POPESTIMATE2010':'POPESTIMATE2015']
          c = p.max(axis=1) - p.min(axis=1)
        
          return census_df['CTYNAME'][c.idxmax()]
answer_seven()
#'Harris County'

Question 8
In this datafile, the United States is broken up into four regions using the "REGION" column.
Create a query that finds the counties that belong to regions 1 or 2, whose name starts with 'Washington', and whose POPESTIMATE2015 was greater than their POPESTIMATE 2014.
This function should return a 5x2 DataFrame with the columns = ['STNAME', 'CTYNAME'] and the same index ID as the census_df (sorted ascending by index).

def answer_eight():
        region = census_df[census_df['REGION'] < 3]
        cc = region[(region['CTYNAME'].str.startswith('Washington')) & ((region['POPESTIMATE2015']) > (region['POPESTIMATE2014']))].loc[:,('STNAME','CTYNAME')]
        return cc
answer_eight()
